These are my own implementations, and the implementations provided in class of Udacity cs373 organized by various units. 
I will provide implementations in various languages as I feel like writing them, but mostly in Python.

I **will not** provide the solutions to any homework assignment both because it's a violation of the honor code and that would ruin the fun for anyone just browsing.
